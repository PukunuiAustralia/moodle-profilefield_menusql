Moodle MenuSQL Profile Field
============================

Description
-----------

Profile field menu selection where key/value pairs are pulled from an SQL statement

Installation
------------

To install it using git, type this command in the root of your Moodle install:
```
git clone git://github.com/PukunuiAustralia/moodle-profilefield_menusql.git user/profile/field/menusql
```
Then add /user/profile/field/menusql to your git ignore.

Alternatively, download the zip from
<https://github.com/PukunuiAustralia/moodle-profilefield_menusql/zipball/master>,
unzip it into the user/profile/field folder, and then rename the new folder to "menusql".

After you have installed this local plugin, you
should see a new option in the settings block:

> Site administration -> Users -> Accounts -> User Profile Fields

We hope you find this tool useful. Please feel free to enhance it.
